If you are looking for instructions involving limelight, you are out of luck :(.

## ------BUILDING------
Building your project is pretty straight forward. 
To build your project, all you have to do is run "./make.py build" in your terminal 
(make sure your terminal is in the proper place where the make file is located - Vision-20xx.
  
## ------DEPLOYING-----
To deploy, connect to the robot and make sure your Raspberry Pi is on (obviously). 
Open up your FRCVision with your Raspberry Pi IP address (the one we have is 10.35.12.3). 
Make sure your console is on to print out messages as necessary. 
Open your "Executable" tab and make sure the executable option is set to "C++ executable", since we program in C++ big brain. 
Click "Select File" and select your project's executable (in this case, it would be called cvTest) and click "Open". 
You now have your executable uploaded!
